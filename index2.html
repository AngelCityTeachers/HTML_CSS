<h1> If you give teachers a text editor and &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tags, they will ask for different 
heading style tags starting with level 1 heading &lt;h1&gt;&lt/h1&gt;. </h1>
<h2> This is level 2 heading </h2>
<h3> This is level 3 heading </h3>
<h4> This is level 4 heading </h4>
<h5> This is level 5 heading. When you give them heading style tags, they will probably want to write more, so they <br>
will ask for paragraph tags.</h5>



<p>When they are finished writing content within paragraph tags, they'll want to use <b>
a break tag to break the line like a return on a keyboard. Then they will type and type <br>
all kinds of things, and will want to view them in the browser. Anything within the body of a web page is displayed in the 
main browser window. </p>

<p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self 
contained unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph is <br />indicated by a new line.  </p>


<p> To make sure you see some very important words, they might want to bold them with the the bold tags. 
This is how we make a word appear &lt;b&gt;&lt;/ bold&gt;. </p> When they are done bolding words, they will want 
to use italics. 

<p> This is how we make a word appear <i> italics </i>. </p> 
<p> Captain Cook sailed to Australia on the  <i> Endeavor </i>. </p>
<p>They might get carried away and forget to structure the page to make the content easier to read, so they will ask
for elements such as lists to be ordered or unordered.</p>
<p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up into units of text.</p>
<p> For example, a book
may have chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. </p>
