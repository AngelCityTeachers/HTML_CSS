    <!-- LESSON 1: This file is saved with an .html or .htm extension. Inside this file, we organize content 
    using tags <>. The content is contained within tags. The page structure begins with a Document
    type or Doctype to let the browser know that this is an HTML page. -->

<!Doctype html>

    <!--Next, we have the html element, which has an opening and closing pair of tags. 
    <html>...</html>. The last tag in an html file is the </html> tag. -->

<html> 

    <!--Inside the html element we have 2 elements: head and body. -->
  
<head>
    <!--inside the head tag are essential tags needed to create a web page, like title, metadata, 
    and internal and external CSS and javascript. These items do not appear on the page, but help the browser display it properly. The content in the title tag appears in the browser. It determines the page title. It is important for search engine optimization. The head tag is always written before the body tag, right after the opening html
tag: We never use attributes on this tag. Inside we can have a variety of tags depeding on
what you need to do: title, script, noscript, link, style, base, meta -->

<title>My First Web Page </title> 

<!--the script tag is used to add Javascript into the page. You can include it in the
inline, using an opening tag, the Javascript code and then the closing tag. -->

<script></script>

<!--you can insert a JS file with a script tag -->
<script src = file.js></script>-->

</head>

  
<!--the body tags is the content of the page. The visible stuff. -->

<body>

<h1> Hello out there! </h1>
<h2> Hello again! </h2>

</body>

</html>


<!--Lesson 2: Let's add to the body element. Let's also add attributes to elements. The starting tag of an element can have special snippets of information we can attach, called attributes. 
Attributes have the key ="value" syntax.
